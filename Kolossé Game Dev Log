///Game Log
/*
Day 1 (12/8/2016)
    Started game developement. Created movement for player character and exparemented with the battle system.
    Created the first town's collission. ALL SPRITES ARE PLACEHOLDERS!!!

Day 2 (12/9/16)
    Created NPC's and movement. Started on the cutscene scripting, using timelines.
    Fixed movement bug where you collide with NPC on a map possition that is not divisable by 32. It made it so that the player or NPC no longer moved on the 32 grid.

Day 3 (12/10/16)
    -Started creating the logic that event tiles disapear once the event passes.
    -May need to create separate objects for each event. Maybe a total of 5 to re-use for each (Game Maker) room.
    -Decided on haveing each event tile object disapear if it's number is not zero and the event happens.
    
Day 4 (12/13/2016)
    -Created scr_eventTracker to help track events and make sure that characters don't disapear if you move from room to room.
    -Moved the Origin point for all overworld characters to be 16, 24. Also modifyed the spr_player_down sprites mask to cover the bottom half of the sprite.
        This makes the overworld characters look like they are moving with depth in front of walls.
     -Assined all the overworld characters mask to be spr_player_down. So I don't have to manualy assine the SAME mask value to each and every sprite, just the objects.
    -Created the (walking) sprites for: Player, Sibling, Mom, Rival, and Professor characters.
    -Organized some folders
    -Fixt bug when character only used 2 frames of animation.
     Characters were forced to reset animation every time they hit there destination_x,Y. Made it so that only when directional buttons are not being pressed, animation stops and resets.
    -Made it so NPC normal speed is half of player's normal speed durring their normal state

Day 5 (12/21/2016)
    -Imported the CTB textbox engine and modified the size of the text box to fit within the game's size in the obj_textbox step event.
    -made it so that there was only one object for the textbox and I would just asigne diffrent scripts to it for diffrent text.
    -Added the text for the first 2 events.
    -Still need to add a talk button comand
    -still needs to make it so when you face an NPC and press the talk button you talk to them

Day 6 (1/6/2017)
    -revamped the event_check to be a character_event array. And had it be created in the con_controler.
     This will be used so that I could call and change spicific character events without haveing to worry about other character's events/quests/diolog patterns.
    - Decided on what to call the monsters. Koloss√©

Day 7 (1/12/2017)
    - Made it so that you can talk to NPCs but their is a bug that makes it so that you can only talk to the NPC from the left or the right.
    - added the text box engin and modified it so that it would fit in the game's screen ratio
    - quests/events sinc up properly with text and the order events that follow behind no longer disapear
    
Day 8 (1/13/2017)
    -fixed the only talking to the NPC from the left or right. Can now talk in all directions
    -NPCs that move in the overworld now stop when you are talking to them
    -Now to fine tune the battle system... But not today

    Battle system
    Art/Astetics
