///Game Log
/*
Day 1 (12/8/2016)
    Started game developement. Created movement for player character and exparemented with the battle system.
    Created the first town's collission. ALL SPRITES ARE PLACEHOLDERS!!!

Day 2 (12/9/16)
    Created NPC's and movement. Started on the cutscene scripting, using timelines.
    Fixed movement bug where you collide with NPC on a map possition that is not divisable by 32. It made it so that the player or NPC no longer moved on the 32 grid.

Day 3 (12/10/16)
    -Started creating the logic that event tiles disapear once the event passes.
    -May need to create separate objects for each event. Maybe a total of 5 to re-use for each (Game Maker) room.
    -Decided on haveing each event tile object disapear if it's number is not zero and the event happens.
    
Day 4 (12/13/2016)
    -Created scr_eventTracker to help track events and make sure that characters don't disapear if you move from room to room.
    -Moved the Origin point for all overworld characters to be 16, 24. Also modifyed the spr_player_down sprites mask to cover the bottom half of the sprite.
